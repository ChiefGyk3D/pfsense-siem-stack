# Project Roadmap

> **From Dashboard Tweak to pfSense Knowledge Base**

This document tracks the evolution of the project and outlines future development plans.

---

## 🎯 Project Vision

Transform from a Grafana dashboard fix into a comprehensive, community-driven pfSense knowledge base covering security, monitoring, automation, and operations—providing battle-tested configurations and troubleshooting strategies for production deployments.

---

## 📅 Project Evolution

### Phase 1: Dashboard Fix (Origin)
**Status**: ✅ Complete

Started as a simple Grafana panel fix, evolved into realizing the monitoring infrastructure needed a complete overhaul.

**Achievements**:
- Fixed broken Grafana panels
- Identified infrastructure limitations
- Recognized need for comprehensive solution

---

### Phase 2: SIEM Infrastructure (Current Focus)
**Status**: 🚧 Active Development (Functional, Documentation Evolving)

#### Completed ✅
- **Multi-Interface Monitoring**: 15 Suricata instances (2 WAN inline IPS + 13 VLAN IDS)
- **Log Forwarder**: Inode-aware rotation handling, GeoIP enrichment, multi-threaded
- **OpenSearch/Logstash Pipeline**: Nested format, index templates, retention policies
- **WAN Security Dashboard**: Attack visualization, signature tracking, geographic mapping
- **Automated Installation**: One-command SIEM stack deployment
- **Watchdog Monitoring**: Auto-restart on failure, health checks
- **PfBlockerNG Integration**: Upstream threat filtering, DNSBL optimization
- **Architecture Documentation**: Mermaid diagrams, data flow visualization

#### In Progress 🚧
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides, troubleshooting scenarios (continuously improving)
- **SID Management**: 219 optimized signatures, 2 conditional suppressions (testing in production)
- **Log Rotation Handling**: Inode-aware forwarder (tested, documenting edge cases)
- **Performance Optimization**: Query tuning, index optimization, resource management

#### Pending 📝
- **LAN Monitoring Dashboard**: East-west traffic visualization, lateral movement detection
- **Alert Rule Library**: Pre-configured detection rules with documentation
- **Multi-Instance Deployment**: Monitoring multiple pfSense firewalls centrally

---

### Phase 3: Knowledge Base Expansion (Next Focus)
**Status**: 📝 Planned

Transform from SIEM-focused to comprehensive pfSense knowledge repository.

#### Planned Features

**Security & IDS/IPS**:
- [ ] Snort integration (currently Suricata-focused)
- [ ] Threat intelligence feeds (MISP, abuse.ch, OTX)
- [ ] Advanced signature tuning strategies
- [ ] IPS performance benchmarking guide
- [ ] False positive database (community-contributed)

**Monitoring & Logging**:
- [ ] pfSense filterlog dashboard (firewall rule analysis)
- [ ] HAProxy monitoring (reverse proxy stats)
- [ ] Unbound DNS analytics (query patterns, blocking stats)
- [ ] DHCP lease tracking dashboard
- [ ] VPN monitoring (OpenVPN, WireGuard, IPsec)
- [ ] Telegraf metrics dashboard (system health, interface stats)

**Automation & Configuration**:
- [ ] Ansible playbooks for deployment
- [ ] Docker/Docker Compose setup
- [ ] Configuration backup/restore procedures
- [ ] Multi-firewall orchestration
- [ ] Automated certificate renewal monitoring

**Operations & Troubleshooting**:
- [ ] Hardware sizing calculator
- [ ] Performance tuning database (CPU, RAM, disk I/O)
- [ ] Common failure scenarios and recovery procedures
- [ ] Upgrade procedures and compatibility matrix
- [ ] Disaster recovery playbook

---

### Phase 4: Community Platform (Long-term Vision)
**Status**: 📝 Conceptual

Build community-driven platform for pfSense knowledge sharing.

#### Vision
- **Configuration Marketplace**: Share and discover pfSense configurations
- **Troubleshooting Database**: Searchable problem/solution repository
- **Benchmark Database**: Community-contributed performance data
- **Tutorial Hub**: Video guides, written tutorials, interactive labs
- **Hardware Registry**: Tested hardware configurations and compatibility
- **Integration Library**: Pre-built integrations with other tools
